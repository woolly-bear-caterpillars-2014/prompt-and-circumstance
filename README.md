## Description
Prompt and Circumstance is a site where logged in user's can create text prompts. Perhaps the body of a joke without a punchline, or a haiku missing a last syllable.

Any logged in user can then submit a response to an existing prompt: suggest a punch line, or a pickup, or finish that haiku.

Logged in users can up or down vote both Prompts and Responses dynamically, to showcase the most popular in each field. Enjoy!

The prompts, their responses and scores are all publically viewable.

## Installation Notes

Clone the repo, run 'bundle install', and voila.
Launch with 'rails s'.
Note - that this app is built on a [postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) database, and you need a postgres equipped server running.
